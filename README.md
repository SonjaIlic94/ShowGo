# Show Go

## Purpose

 Help Users find multiple new music events with the help of they're spotify account preferences in any location of the users choosing!

## Built With

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Bulma
- Moment.js
- Spotify server side API
- Ticketmaster server side API

## Challenges Faced
Challenges faced were getting the 
exact data we need from each of the API’s. On top of that, we 
had to create a way for the two API’s to “speak” with each 
other.

## What we hope to implement
A feature we can’t wait to implement is to be able to go through more of the user’s playlists and listening history. For the MVP, it currently reads through only the most recent of the user’s playlist. Down the line, we would have it go through a more detailed review of the user’s profile. Another feature we want to add is a Watchlist for the user – something that will notify you when the events you’ve favourited have gone on sale.
